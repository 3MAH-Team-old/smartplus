About
-----

smartplus is a free, open-source library for the simulation of heterogeneous materials. It is developed with the aim to be a high-quality scientific library to facilitate the analysis of the complex, non-linear composite material response and thus integrates several algorithms for the analysis of heterogeneous materials

smartplus is a C++ library with emphasis on speed and ease-of-use. Its principle focus is to provide tools to facilitate the implementation of up-to-date constitutive model for materials in Finite Element Analysis Packages. This is done by providing a C++ API to generate user material subroutine based on a library of functions. Also, SMART+ provides tools to analyse the behavior of material, considering loading at the material point level. Such tools include a thermomechanical solver, a software to predict effective properties of composites, and a built-in identification software (using a combined genetic-gradient based algorithm)

smartplus is mainly developed by contributors from the staff and students of Arts et MÃ©tiers ParisTech, that are members of the LEM3 laboratory. It is released under the GNU General Public License: GPL, version 3.

Installation
------------

How to install SMART+ :

1 - Make sure you have Boost (1.60 at least) installed and Armadillo installed to use smartplus.

2 - Unzip the file in a source location, and rename it 'smartplus'.

3 - Go to such folder "smartplus"

4 - Execute the installation bash file : 

```bash
sh Install.sh
```

5 - Enjoy

##
If you start from an Ubuntu 16.04, you can also use the script "install-smartplus.sh"
It contains all the commands to install the smartplus dependancies
Just run "install-smartplus.sh" on a terminal, with the su privileges

How to use smartplus
--------------------

Several possibilities 

1 - Use the python wrapper for smartplus, simmit :

[![simmit](https://img.shields.io/badge/simmit-v0.9-blue.svg)](https://github.com/chemiskyy/simmit)

By doing, so, you can utilize smartplus in Ipython (jupyter) notebooks

2 - Use the executables provided by smartplus

For instance, a solver, an identification software, etc..

3 - Link smartplus with FEA Packages

An example is provided on how to use smartplus constitutive models as Umat libraries:

You can directly copy-paste "umat_single.o" (mechanical) or "umat_singleT.o" (thermomechanical) from 'pathtothefile'/smartplus/build/bin to your Abaqus work directory and use it like a classical Umat.

Example : 
```bash
abaqus job=mymodel.inp user=umat_single.o
```

4- Build your own projects using the SMART+ library

Have fun :)
